# Neural Style Transfer

This is an implementation of the paper titled 'A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style' (Gatys, Ecker, Bethge 2015) using Keras.  

### To run:  
Make sure all packages in the requirements.txt file are installed.  
Edit cell 8 in neural_style_transfer_cnn.ipynb to point to your content and style images. There are example style images in the style_images folder.  
Run the Jupyter notebook (neural_style_transfer_cnn.ipynb).
